# Pogos LLC Software Engineering Exercise - Pipe17 project

## Overview
Let us imagine we operate a highly popular product stand at the local farmer’s market, offering a variety of products that customers love.
However, managing inventory, sales, loyalty programs, and customer interactions has become a major challenge.
To streamline operations and eliminate paper-based processes, we seek an application to simplify these tasks.

## Core Use Case
- Customers select products
- Products are weighed and priced
- Customers make payments and receive the receipts and change
- The same customers may return for additional purchases

## Current Challenges
- Managing high customer traffic and product browsing
- Inefficient inventory tracking relying on paper records
- Applying variable discounts to total order sales
- Pricing products based on weight
- Implementing daily discounts on specific products
- Managing rewards for customers with frequent visits

## What We're Looking For
Design a data model and API for the order creation and update use case, focusing on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
The technology stack should include Node.js and ReactJS, with MongoDB preferred for the database.
While the main emphasis is on backend development, you may include a basic UI if time allows.

## Possible Scenarios
- Customer management
- Employee tracking
- Product inventory management
- Inventory tracking
- Variable pricing based on weight
- Daily discounts on specific products
- Loyalty program management
- Customer, inventory, and sales reporting
- Digital receipts
- Returns processing
